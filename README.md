Another small retarded project I made between my break.

Basic stuff-
This isn't supposed to be a whole accurate stock ticker but it's just a small data analysis tool consisting of data on Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Tata Steel and Nvidia stock prices and history from 19th of Jan 2021 to 19th of Jan 2022.

You can run it by installing all required packages, and to simply run the webb app just use {streamlit run "your directory on which the file is saved"} example "streamlit run "C:/Users/MSI/Desktop/System stability testing/program files/python-stock/main.py"

Lastly, why would you even run it? lol Are you out of your mind?
